                <p>
                  The main goal of this project was to create a functional
                  recipes platform, where users can explore a variety of dishes
                  and search for specific recipes. This project allowed me to
                  demonstrate my technical skills, particularly in creating
                  smooth navigation, designing an intuitive layout, and
                  implementing an effective search feature.

                <h3> Challenges Faced : </h3>
                <p>
                  One of the main challenges I encountered was implementing the
                  <span> search feature </span> and ensuring it integrated
                  seamlessly with all components. This involved passing data
                  across multiple components and ensuring accurate and efficient
                  filtering for usersâ€™ search queries. Overcoming this challenge
                  improved my understanding of <span> data flow in React </span>
                  and strengthened my problem-solving skills.
